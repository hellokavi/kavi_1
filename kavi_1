Domain Generating Algorithms are in use by cybercriminals to prevent their servers from being blacklisted or taken down. The algorithm produces random looking domain names. The idea is that two machines using the same algorithm will contact the same domain at a given time, so they will be able to exchange information or fetch instructions.
